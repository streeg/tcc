This study presents an approach to enhance the detection of vulnerabilities in Java cryptographic APIs,
aiming to strengthen the security of applications based on this technology. For this purpose,
we integrated the CogniCrypt and CryptoGuard tools with LibScout, allowing the identification
of the origin of warnings related to external libraries. This qualitative approach represents
an advancement in promoting security in Java applications, contributing to a more resilient
digital ecosystem protected against potential cyber threats. By incorporating the identification
of the origin of warnings, we also enable direct suggestions to the developers of the libraries,
optimizing the vulnerability correction process. After analyzing more than 200 Android applications,
we observed that for the CogniCrypt tool, we had a total of 6,798 warnings, with 2,436 belonging
to external libraries, and for CryptoGuard, we had a total of 2,710 warnings, with 1,394
belonging to external libraries.
